# gogole-v1
A clone of the home page of the popular Search Engine Google, manually writed by me, rebranded as Gogole because I'm scared of copyright.

This is my first project in html&css, the search bar is working (redirecting to the official google.com/search) and the design is kinda fine for a first project.
The logo is made by me.
There may be a newer version in the future with a cleaner code because this is horrible, or I may update this one.

I know it's not perfect but it's mine and I love it.

I did not make it to do any profits or to claim "Gogole" as a new search engine with a stolen design, it was only made for fun (Basically educational purposes).
